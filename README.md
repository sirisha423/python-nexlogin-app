> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Why I Built This
> Employees at my company frequently forgot to clock in, leading to errors in time tracking and even salary deductions.
>
> - Employees often forgot to clock in, requiring manual adjustments by admins
> - Time tracking was prone to mistakes and salary issues 
> - The login process was slow , Open chrome and login and then press clock-in  
> - Employees had to log in every time they started their system, creating extra effort
>
> This led to inefficiency, increased administrative workload, and a frustrating user experience.
>
> ---
> 
> ### How I Solved the Problem
>
> So I built CRM Login Enhancer — a desktop app that:
> - Optimizes login times to ***3X Faster***, making it faster and more efficient
> - Remembers login credentials for seamless access after the first login
> - Runs automatically at system startup, ensuring users are always ready to clock in  
> - Syncs employee data (name, position, etc.) directly from the company’s CRM AP
>
> It's designed for both tech-savvy employees and non-technical users — providing an easy-to-use interface that speeds up login, reduces administrative tasks, and ensures accurate time tracking for everyone

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <img src="src/git/key-api.png" alt="API Settings" width="200px" /><br>
        <sub>API Settings</sub>
      </td>
      <td align="center">

        <sub>Clock-In Calendar</sub>

    </tr>
